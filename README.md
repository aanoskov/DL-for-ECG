# DL-for-ECG

Here's demonstated 2 python notebooks about work with ECG-signals dataset from https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.1/. The first one is about data preproceesing: rescaling, multilabeling, emissions deleting. The second one is about the Convolution Neural Network which was fitting on Google Colaboratory and has 86% accuracy (with best hyper-parameters).
